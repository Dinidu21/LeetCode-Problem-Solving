# Intuition
The goal of the "Two Sum" problem is to find two indices in an array of integers such that their corresponding values add up to a given target. The challenge is to solve the problem efficiently, ideally in a single pass through the array.

# Approach
1. **Use a HashMap to Track Complementary Values:**
   - A `HashMap` is used to store the value of each element as the key and its index as the value.
   - As you iterate through the array, you calculate the value (`k`) needed to add to the current element (`nums[i]`) to reach the target (`target - nums[i]`).
   - If `k` already exists in the `HashMap`, it means that you have previously encountered the value needed to complete the sum. Thus, you can immediately return the current index `i` and the index stored in the `HashMap` for `k`.
   - If `k` is not found in the `HashMap`, add the current element and its index to the map, and continue iterating.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Traverse through the entire array only once.
   - This ensures an efficient solution with minimal time complexity.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:**
  - The time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of elements in the array. This is because you only iterate through the array once, and the `HashMap` operations (`put` and `containsKey`) take constant time $$O(1)$$.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is $$O(n)$$ because, in the worst case, you may need to store all elements in the `HashMap`.

# Explanation for Example: `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, Target: `9`
- **First Iteration (i = 0):**
  - `nums[i] = 2`
  - `k = target - nums[i] = 9 - 2 = 7`
  - `7` is not in the map, so add `2` with index `0` to the map.

- **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
  - `nums[i] = 7`
  - `k = target - nums[i] = 9 - 7 = 2`
  - `2` is in the map, which means that `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` add up to `9`.
  - Return `[0, 1]`.

This approach efficiently finds the indices that sum up to the target.

# Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class TwoSum1 {
    public static int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int k = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(k)) {
                return new int[] {map.get(k), i};
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        
        return new int[]{};
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = twoSum(new int[]{2, 7, 11, 15}, 9);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(nums));
    }
}
```

This solution is highly efficient and uses a `HashMap` to solve the "Two Sum" problem in linear time. It ensures that the required indices are found without the need for nested loops, which would result in a less optimal $$O(n^2)$$ time complexity.
