# Intuition
To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams, both strings must contain the exact same characters with the same frequencies. Thus, if we count the occurrences of each character in both strings and compare these counts, we can determine if the strings are anagrams.

# Approach
1. **Check Length:**
    - If the lengths of `s` and `t` are not the same, return `false`. This is because two strings with different lengths cannot be anagrams.

2. **Count Character Frequencies:**
    - Create two integer arrays `occaranceOfS` and `occaranceOfT` of size 26 to represent the frequency of each character (assuming the input strings consist only of lowercase English letters).
    - Traverse each character of `s` and `t` and increment the corresponding index in `occaranceOfS` and `occaranceOfT` respectively. The index is calculated using `c - 'a'`, which gives the position of the character in the alphabet (e.g., `'a'` corresponds to index `0`, `'b'` to index `1`, etc.).

3. **Compare Frequencies:**
    - Use `Arrays.equals(occaranceOfS, occaranceOfT)` to compare the frequency arrays. If they are equal, then `s` and `t` are anagrams and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:**
    - The time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input strings. This is because you need to iterate over both strings to count the character frequencies.
    - Comparing the two frequency arrays also takes $$O(26)$$ time, which is constant and can be ignored for large values of `n`.

- **Space Complexity:**
    - The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ since the frequency arrays are of a fixed size (26). Thus, the space required does not depend on the length of the input strings.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        int[] occaranceOfS = new int[26];
        int[] occaranceOfT = new int[26];

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            occaranceOfS[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            occaranceOfT[c - 'a']++;
        }

        return Arrays.equals(occaranceOfS, occaranceOfT);
    }
}
```

This approach ensures that both strings are compared character-wise in an efficient manner. It avoids sorting the strings, which would take $$O(n \log n)$$ time, and instead provides an $$O(n)$$ solution by utilizing frequency counting.
