 # Intuition
The goal is to determine whether a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

The main challenge in this problem is to:
1. Ignore all non-alphanumeric characters.
2. Make the comparison case-insensitive.

# Approach
To solve the problem, you followed these steps:

1. **Extract Valid Characters:**
    - Create an empty `StringBuilder` called `given`.
    - Traverse the input string character by character.
    - If the character is alphanumeric (`Character.isAlphabetic()` or `Character.isDigit()`), convert it to lowercase (`Character.toLowerCase()`) and add it to `given`.
    - This ensures only the valid characters are included and case differences are ignored.

2. **Reverse the String:**
    - Create another `StringBuilder` called `ans`.
    - Iterate over `given` in reverse order and append each character to `ans`.
    - This creates a reversed version of the valid string.

3. **Compare Original and Reversed Strings:**
    - Use `StringBuilder.compareTo()` to compare `given` and `ans`.
    - If they are equal (`compareTo()` returns `0`), the original string is a palindrome, otherwise it is not.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:**
    - The time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input string. This is because you iterate over the string twice: once to filter the valid characters and once to reverse them.

- **Space Complexity:**
    - The space complexity is $$O(n)$$ as well, because you are using two `StringBuilder` objects to store the filtered and reversed strings.

# Explanation for Test Case: "0P"
- After filtering the valid characters from "0P", you get "0p" (lowercased).
- The reversed version of "0p" is "p0".
- Since "0p" is not equal to "p0", the result is `false`, which is the expected output for this test case.
- if (Character.isAlphabetic(c) || Character.isDigit(c)) 

### # Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return true;
        }
        StringBuilder given = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isAlphabetic(c) || Character.isDigit(c)) {
                given.append(Character.toLowerCase(c));
            }
        }
        //System.out.println(given);
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = given.toString().length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ans.append(given.charAt(i));
        }
        //System.out.println(ans);
        return given.compareTo(ans) == 0;
    }
}
```

This solution ensures that only alphanumeric characters are considered and ignores cases, effectively solving the issue that many might face with test cases like `"0P"`â€”which should return `false` since `"0"` and `"P"` are not the same character.
